# Fashion Recommender using ResNet

## Overview
This project implements a Fashion Recommender System using the ResNet architecture. The system recommends fashion items such as clothing and accessories to users based on their preferences and previous interactions with similar items. The recommendation process involves training a deep learning model on the Fashion Product Images Dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model can be found on Kaggle: [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset). It contains a large collection of fashion product images across various categories, including clothing, footwear, and accessories.
## Training
Train the the model and run it using streamlit
